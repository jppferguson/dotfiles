## Context

This file is part of the Agentrc standards system. These global best practices are referenced by all product codebases and provide default development guidelines. Individual projects may extend or override these practices in their `.agentrc/product/dev-best-practices.md` file.

## Core Principles

### Keep It Simple

- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones

### Optimize for Readability

- Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for "why" not "what"

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated business logic to private methods
- Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components
- Create utility functions for common operations

## Dependencies

### Choose Libraries Wisely

When adding third-party dependencies:

- Select the most popular and actively maintained option
- Check the library's GitHub repository for:
  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)
  - Active issue resolution
  - Number of stars/downloads
  - Clear documentation

## Code Organization

### File Structure

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
